What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  An .git directory is created where all the metadata, that keeps track
  of the evolution of the repository, it's saved

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 Only the staging area's file are going to be commited to the repository.
 It allow you not no commit all the files that you are working with, so you can
 use temporally files or notes that you don't want to have in the repository.
