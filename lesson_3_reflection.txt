When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would prefer a remote repository in a collaboratory project or if I need to
    change from one computer to another

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    That way you don't need to bother whether other people make changes on the
    repository or not.
