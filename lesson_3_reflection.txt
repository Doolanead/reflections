When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would prefer a remote repository in a collaboratory project or if I need to
    change from one computer to another

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    That way you don't need to bother whether other people make changes on the
    repository or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: a clone made in Github from another Github's repository
    use->Copy, edit and give honors to the authors' repository
Clone: copy one Github's repository to a local repository or local to local
    use->Copy and edit one repository
Branch: Make an alternative version of the repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
 stored locally?
    In that case it's possible to advance the proyect offline and then merge to
    the newest version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
  I would merge the different version and features of a project manually, and i
  would use asana or other platform to agree the changes with my coworkers.
  I think everything would be harder.
